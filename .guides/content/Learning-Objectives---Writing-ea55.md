## Assumptions
Students have completed the module on strings. Students are familiar with `try... catch... finally` blocks.

## Limitations
These problems will be working with text files. Students will only use the `BufferedWriter` class, and they will not use the `append` method when appending a file. The will continue to use the `write` method.
