## Recursion Exercise 1

**Problem**
Write a recursive method called `recursiveSum` that takes an integer as a parameter. Return the sum of all integers between 0 and the number passed to `recursiveSum`. **Do not** alter the code on line 5; this is needed for the evaluation.

**Expected Output**
* If the method call is `recursiveSum(5)`, then the method would return `15`
* If the method call is `recursiveSum(10)`, then the method would return `55`
