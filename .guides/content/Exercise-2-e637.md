## Conditionals Exercise 2

**Problem**
Use the variable `x` as you write this program. `x` will represent a positive integer. Write a program that determines if `x` is divisible by 5. If yes, print `_ is divisible by 5`, where the blank is the value of `x`. If no, print `_ is not divisible by 5`, where the blank is the value of `x`.

<details><summary><b>Type Casting</b></summary>Use the <code>String.valueOf(x)</code> command to type cast the variable <code>x</code> as a string.</details><br>

**Expected Output**
* If `x` is `50`, then the output would be: `50 is divisible by 5`.
* If `x` is `37`, then the output would be: `37 is not divisible by 5`.

### Compile code after you make changes

{Compile Code}(javac code/conditionals/Exercise2.java)

### Test your code with a few different values

{Test with 50}(java -cp code/conditionals/ Exercise2 50)

{Test with 37}(java -cp code/conditionals/ Exercise2 37)
