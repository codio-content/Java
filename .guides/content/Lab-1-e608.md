## Lab 1 - Recursive Tree

![Recursive Tree](.guides/img/fractal_tree.png)

Trees can be drawn recursively. Draw a branch. At the end of the branch, draw two smaller branches with one to the left and the other to the right. Repeat until a certain condition is true. This program will walk you through drawing a tree in this way.

Start by declaring a turtle object `t`, and define the function `recursiveTree`. This function should take three parameters, `branchLength`, `angle`, and `t`.

```java
public class RecursiveTree {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    //add code below this line
    
    Turtle t = new Turtle(0, 100);
    
    //add code above this line
  }
  
  //add method definitions below this line
  
  /**
  * @param integer branchLength
  * @param integer angle
  * @param Turtle t
  * @return draws a branch of the tree
  */
  public static void recursiveTree(int branchLength, int angle, Turtle t) {
    
  }
  
  
  //add method definitions above this line
}
```

The base case for this function is a bit different. In previous examples, if the base case is true a value was returned. The function `recursiveTree` does not return a value, it draws on the screen. So the base case will be to keep recursing as long as `branchLength` is greater than some value. Define the base case as `branchLength` as being greater than 5.

```java
  //add method definitions below this line
  
  /**
  * @param integer branchLength
  * @param integer angle
  * @param Turtle t
  * @return draws a branch of the tree
  */
  public static void recursiveTree(int branchLength, int angle, Turtle t) {
    if (branchLength > 5) {
      
    }
  }
  
  
  //add method definitions above this line
```

Start drawing the tree by going forward and turning right. Call `recursiveTree` again, but reduce `branchLength` by 15. The code should run, but the tree will not look like a tree. It looks more like a curve made of series of line segments decreasing in size.

```java
  //add method definitions below this line

  /**
  * @param integer branchLength
  * @param integer angle
  * @param Turtle t
  * @return draws a branch of the tree
  */
  public static void recursiveTree(int branchLength, int angle, Turtle t) {
    if (branchLength > 5) {
      t.forward(branchLength);
      t.right(angle);
      recursiveTree(branchLength - 15, angle, t);
    }
  }
  //add method definitions above this line
```

Do not forget to call the `recursiveTree` function and pass in some initial values.

```java
    //add code below this line
    Turtle t = new Turtle(0, 100);
    recursiveTree(45, 20, t);  
    //add code above this line
```

The next step is to draw the branch that goes off to the left. Since the turtle turned to the right the number of degrees that the parameter `angle` represents, the turtle needs to turn to the left twice the degrees of `angle`. Turning to the left `angle` will put the turtle back at its original heading. The turtle needs to go further to the left. Then draw another branch whose length is reduced by 15.

```java
  //add method definitions below this line
  
  /**
  * @param integer branchLength
  * @param integer angle
  * @param Turtle t
  * @return draws a branch of the tree
  */
  public static void recursiveTree(int branchLength, int angle, Turtle t) {
    if (branchLength > 5) {
      t.forward(branchLength);
      t.right(angle);
      recursiveTree(branchLength - 15, angle, t);
      t.left(angle * 2);
      recursiveTree(branchLength - 15, angle, t);
    }
  }
  //add method definitions above this line
```

{Try it|terminal}(bash .guides/turtleRecursion.sh javac RecursiveTree.java java RecursiveTree 2)

The tree is looking better, but there are two more things that need to be done. First, put the turtle back to its original heading by turning right `angle` degrees. Then go backwards the length of the branch. Call the `recursive_tree` function to draw a tree.

```java
  //add method definitions below this line
  
  /**
  * @param integer branchLength
  * @param integer angle
  * @param Turtle t
  * @return draws a branch of the tree
  */
  public static void recursiveTree(int branchLength, int angle, Turtle t) {
    if (branchLength > 5) {
      t.forward(branchLength);
      t.right(angle);
      recursiveTree(branchLength - 15, angle, t);
      t.left(angle * 2);
      recursiveTree(branchLength - 15, angle, t);
      t.right(angle);
      t.backward(branchLength);
    }
  }
  //add method definitions above this line
```

{Try it|terminal}(bash .guides/turtleRecursion.sh javac RecursiveTree.java java RecursiveTree 3)

## What happens if you:
* Increase the branch length when calling `recursiveTree` for the first time?
* Increase and decrease the angle when calling `recursiveTree` for the first time?
* When decreasing `branchLength`, change 15 to something smaller (be sure to change all of the 15's)?
* Change the base case to `if (branchLength > 1)`?
* Rotate the turtle 90 degrees to the left before calling `recursiveTree` for the first time?
