## Conditionals Exercise 3

**Problem**
Use the variable `x` as you write this program. `x` will represent a positive integer. Write a program that determines if `x` is divisible by 5 and even. If yes, print `_ is divisible by 5 and even`, where the blank is the value of `x`. If no, print `_ is not divisible by 5 or it is odd`, where the blank is the value of `x`.

**Expected Output**
* If `x` is `8`, then the output would be: `37 is not divisible by 5 or it is odd`.
* If `x` is `80`, then the output would be: `50 is divisible by 5 and even`.
* If `x` is `105`, then the output would be: `37 is not divisible by 5 or it is odd`.


### Compile code after you make changes

{Compile Code}(javac code/conditionals/Exercise3.java)

### Test your code with a few different values

{Test with 8}(java -cp code/conditionals/ Exercise3 8)

{Test with 80}(java -cp code/conditionals/ Exercise3 80)

{Test with 105}(java -cp code/conditionals/ Exercise3 105)
