## Exercise 5

**Problem**
Write a program that captures input from the user and swaps the letters two at a time in the string. The first two characters change places, the third and fourth characters change places, etc. If the string has an odd number of characters, the last character will remain as it is. Assume that the program will only take an **even** number of characters, otherwise, there will be an error.

```java
public class Exercise5 {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    
    String my_string = args[0];
    
    //add code below this line
    

    
    //add code above this line
  }
}
```

### Click to compile your code
{Compile Code}(javac code/strings/Exercise5.java)

### Test your code with a few different values

{Test with home}(java -cp code/strings/ Exercise5 home)
<details><summary><b>Expected Output</b></summary><code>ohem</code></details><br>

{Test with ocidgn}(java -cp code/strings/ Exercise5 ocidgn)
<details><summary><b>Expected Output</b></summary><code>coding</code></details><br>

### Requirements
* You **should not** make any changes to the code that already exists. If you accidentally delete any existing code, you can copy and paste the entire program from above.
* You can use **any** number of string methods and/or conditionals to produce the desired output.
