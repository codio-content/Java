## Exercise 4

**Problem**
Write a program that takes input from a user. Print the first half of the string on one line, and the second half on another. In the case of a string that has an odd number of characters, the second line will have the extra character. **Important**, do not put a prompt when asking for user input. Just use `input()`. Adding a prompt will cause your program to not pass the tests.

**Expected Output**
* If the user inputs `home`, the output will be:
```python
ho
me
```
* If the user inputs `hooray Python`, the output will be:
```python
hooray
 Python
```
