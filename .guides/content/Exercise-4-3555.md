## Exercise 4

**Problem**
Write a program that takes input **without white spaces** from a user, prints the first half of the string on one line, and the second half on another. In the case of a string that has an odd number of characters, the second line will have the extra character.

Here is what you have so far:
```java
public class Exercise4 {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    
    String myString = args[0];
    
    //add code below this line
    

    
    //add code above this line
  }
}
```

### Click to compile your code
{Compile Code}(javac code/strings/Exercise4.java)

### Test your code with a few different values

{Test with Java}(java -cp code/strings/ Exercise4 Java)
<details><summary><b>Expected Output</b></summary><code>Ja</code><br><code>va</code></details><br>

{Test with hello}(java -cp code/strings/ Exercise4 hello)
<details><summary><b>Expected Output</b></summary><code>he</code><br><code>llo</code></details><br>

### Requirements
* You **should not** make any changes to the code that already exists. If you accidentally delete any existing code, you can copy and paste the entire program from above.
* You can use **any** number of string methods and/or conditionals to produce the desired output.
