## Recursion Exercise 3

**Problem**
Write a recursive method called `bunnyEars` that takes the number of bunnies (an integer) as a parameter. Return the number of bunny ears (2 per bunny). Use addition instead of multiplication. **Do not** alter the code on line 5; this is needed for the evaluation.

**Expected Output**
* If the method call is `bunnyEars(8)`, then the method would return `16`
* If the method call is `bunnyEars(0)`, then the method would return `0`
