## Print the Array
Given the current program within the text editor to your left:
```java
public class Exercise1 {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    
    String[] oceans = {"Pacific", "Atlantic", "Indian", "Arctic", "Southern"};
    
    //add code below this line



    //add code above this line
  }
}
```

Complete the program so that the resulting output will be:

```java
Pacific
Atlantic
Indian
Arctic
Southern
```

### Requirements
* You **cannot** make any changes to the code that already exists. If you accidentally delete any existing code, you can copy and paste the entire program from above.
* You **must** include the array name `oceans` in your code so that each element of the array can be printed.
* You **cannot** print the individual Strings `Pacific`, `Atlantic`, `Indian`, `Arctic`, and `Southern` in your code. Instead, refer to the array elements themselves.
* Each element should be printed with a **newline**.
