## Conditionals Exercise 4

**Problem**
Use the variable `x` as you write this program. `x` will represent a string. Write a program using the `elif` keyword that determines if `x` is a primary color (red, blue, or yellow). If yes, print `_ is primary color`, where the blank is the value of `x`. If no, print `_ is not a primary color`, where the blank is the value of `x`.

**Expected Output**
* If `x` is `red`, then the output would be: `red is a primary color`.
* If `x` is `teal`, then the output would be: `teal is not a primary color`.


**Important**
You will need to declare the variable `x` as you write and test your code. However, do not submit your code to be graded with the variable declaration. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
