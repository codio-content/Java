In programming you often want to repeat sections of code. We call this concept of repeating code **iteration**.

**Iteration** is when you repeatedly execute a section of code. 

There are two important pieces to iteration:
1. How many times are you repeating/iterating?
1. What are you iterating?

Thre are a number of ways to iterate in Java which allow you to answer these questions differently. You could itereate for a set number or unknown number of times (possibly even for infinity!) You could iterate over your entire program or just a small piece.
