* ### Create a 2D array using both the *initializer list* and *new* methods
* ### Access and modify 2D array elements
* ### Iterate through 2D arrays using both a regular `for` loop and an *enhanced* `for` loop
* ### Determine 2D array output

## Assumptions
This unit assumes that students have covered operators, conditionals, and loops.

## Limitations
This unit does not cover adding or removing objects to 2D arrays. This unit also does not cover iterating through Strings. These topics will be covered in later units.
