## Files Exercise 1

**Problem**
Write a program that reads a text file and returns the number of lines as well as the total number of characters in the file.

**Expected Output**
Your program **must** include the following line of code:

```java
    String path = args[0];
    //add code below this line
    
    
    
    //add code above this line
```
The variable `path` allows for different text files to be sent to your program for testing. The `TRY IT` button below will send a test file to your program. You should see the following output:

```text
4 lines
228 characters
```

  Unfortunately, the code visualizer does not work with external files, so it cannot be used for this problem.
