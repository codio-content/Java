## Lab 2

This lab uses a comma delimited CSV file `filesLab2.csv`, which contains integers. There are three columns and four rows. The program below will print the sum for each row in the CSV.

Start by having the variable `path` contain the file path for the CSV file. For now, use a `try` block to create a `CSVReader` object. Print any errors with a `catch` block, and leave a message that the CSV file was read with a `finally` block. Running the code should print the message from the `finally` block.

```java
    //add code below this line
    String path = "studentFolder/labs/filesLab2.csv";
    try {
      CSVReader reader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(path));
      
      reader.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e);
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Finished reading a CSV");
    }
    
    //add code above this line 
```

Iterate over the file with an enhanced loop. For each iteration create the variable `total` and set its value to 0. Use a nested enhanced loop to iterate over each row from the CSV file. Increment `total` with each number from the file. **Remember**, data from the CSV file is read as a string, so type cast the value to an integer. Running the code should print the message from the `finally` block.

```java
    //add code below this line
    String path = "studentFolder/labs/filesLab2.csv";
    try {
      CSVReader reader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(path));
      for (String[] row : reader) {
        int total = 0;
        for (String number : row) {
          total += Integer.parseInt(number);
        }
      }
      
      reader.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e);
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Finished reading a CSV");
    }
    
    //add code above this line 
```

{Try it}(sh .guides/csv.sh Lab2 2)

Once the inner loop stops running the variable `total` should have to the sum of the row of integers. Print the value of `total` with a short explanation.

```java
    //add code below this line
    String path = "studentFolder/labs/filesLab2.csv";
    try {
      CSVReader reader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(path));
      for (String[] row : reader) {
        int total = 0;
        for (String number : row) {
          total += Integer.parseInt(number);
        }
        System.out.println("The total value is: " + String.valueOf(total));
      }
      
      reader.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e);
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Finished reading a CSV");
    }
    
    //add code above this line 
```

{Try it}(sh .guides/csv.sh Lab2 3)

Your program should print the following output:

```text
The total value is: 10
The total value is: 151
The total value is: 63
The total value is: 127
```
