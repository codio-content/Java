## The In Operator
The `in` operator tells you if a character or a string is present in another string. `in` returns a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.

```python
my_string = "The brown dog jumps over the lazy fox."

print("dog" in my_string)
```

{try it}(python3 code/strings/string-in.py 1)
