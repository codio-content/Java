## Assumptions
This unit assumes that students have covered operators, especially the `%` operator. This unit also assumes that students have covered conditionals and loops.

## Limitations
This unit does not cover adding or removing objects to arrays. This unit also does not cover iterating through Strings. These topics will be covered in later units.
