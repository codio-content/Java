* ### Use the `return` keyword to return a value
* ### Identify the return value of the print statement
* ### Demonstrate the ability to return several different data types
* ### Define a side effects

## Assumptions
All of the functions lessons assume the students have done everything but recursion. Emphasis will be placed on functions that return a value instead of those that have side effects. 

## Limitations
Students will not see that functions can return other functions or objects. Examples focus on data types covered in an earlier lesson. Students will also be introduced to the idea of "better" code with regards to side effects, i.e. try to reduce side effects when writing functions.
