## Lab 3

The following program will ask the user to enter the name of a superhero and then to enter their superpower. These two pieces of information will be written to the CSV file called `superheroes.csv`. When the user enters `stop` for the superhero name, the program will stop running.

Start by creating the variable `path` with the file path for the CSV file. In addition, create a variable to represent a `Scanner` object as you will be entering information through the terminal.

```java   
    //add code below this line
    String path = "studentFolder/labs/superheroes.csv";
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    //add code above this line 
```

Next, create a `try... catch... finally` block that creates a `CSVWriter` object that appends to the file, prints any exceptions, and ends with a message that the program wrote to the CSV file. Running the program should print the message from the `finally` block (even though nothing has been written to file).

```java   
    //add code below this line
    String path = "studentFolder/labs/superheroes.csv";
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    try {
      CSVWriter writer = new CSVWriter(new FileWriter(path, true));
      
      writer.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e);
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Finished writing to a CSV file");
    }
    
    //add code above this line 
```

{Try it | terminal}(sh .guides/csv.sh Lab3 1)

The program should run until the user enters `stop`. Use a while loop and prompt the user to enter the superhero's name. Be sure to check if the name is `stop`. If so, break out of the loop. When you run the program, you should see the prompt to enter the name. Add a name and make sure you are prompted again. Enter `stop` and verify that you see the message from the `finally` block.

```java
    //add code below this line
    String path = "studentFolder/labs/superheroes.csv";
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    try {
      CSVWriter writer = new CSVWriter(new FileWriter(path, true));
      while (true) {
        System.out.println("Enter the superhero's name (type 'stop' to quit):");
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        if (name.equals("stop")) {
          break;
        }
      }
      
      writer.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e);
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Finished writing to a CSV file");
    }
    
    //add code above this line 
```

{Try it | terminal}(sh .guides/csv.sh Lab3 2)

Finally, prompt the user for the superhero's power. Combine the name and power into an array of strings and write the array to the CSV file. Run the program and add several superheroes. After entering `stop`, click on the link below to open the CSV file and make sure that the information is written to file. Run it again to verify that additional information is being appending to the file.

```java   
    //add code below this line
    String path = "studentFolder/labs/superheroes.csv";
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    try {
      CSVWriter writer = new CSVWriter(new FileWriter(path, true));
      while (true) {
        System.out.println("Enter the superhero's name (type 'stop' to quit):");
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        if (name.equals("stop")) {
          break;
        }
        System.out.println("Enter the superhero's power:");
        String power = sc.nextLine();
        String[] row = {name, power};
        writer.writeNext(row);
      }
      
      writer.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e);
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Finished writing to a CSV file");
    }
    
    //add code above this line 
```
