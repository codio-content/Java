## Lab Challenge

Write a program that reads the text file. This file is stored in the variable `path`. **Do not alter this line of code.** The file contains several instances of the word `Burma`. Replace each instance of `Burma` with `Myanmar`, and print the results of this transformation. The final output of your program should be:

```text

The capital of Myanmar is Naypyidaw.
Its population is about 54 million people.
