## Conditionals Exercise 5

**Problem**
Use the variable `x` as you write this program. `x` will represent a string. Write a program that determines if `x` is a vowel (*a, e, i, o,* and *u* ). If yes, print `_ is a vowel`, where the blank is the value of `x`. If no, print `_ is not a vowel`, where the blank is the value of `x`.

**Expected Output**
* If `x` is `a`, then the output would be: `a is a vowel`.
* If `x` is `z`, then the output would be: `z is not a vowel`.


**Important**
You will need to declare the variable `x` as you write and test your code. However, do not submit your code to be graded with the variable declaration. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
