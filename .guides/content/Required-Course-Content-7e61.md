| **MOD-1**<br>Some objects or concepts are so frequently represented that programmers can draw upon existing code that has already been tested, enabling them to write solutions more quickly and with a greater degree of confidence. 	| **MOD-1.A** <br>Call `System` class methods to generate output to the console. 	| **MOD-1.A.1**<br>`System.out.print` and `System.out.println` display information on the computer monitor.<br><br>**MOD-1.A.2**<br>`System.out.println` moves the cursor to a new line after the information has been displayed, while `System.out.print` does not. 	|
| **VAR-1**<br>To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers include variables in their code so that the same algorithm runs using different input values.                                                             	| **VAR-1.A**<br>Create string literals.                                            	| **VAR-1.A.1**<br>A string literal is enclosed in double quotes.                                                                                                                                                                                                     	|

## Suggested Skills
**2.B**
Determine the result or output based on statement execution order in a code segment without method calls (other than output).

**4.B**
Identify errors in program code.



## Assumptions
This is the first lesson that students will encounter. No other knowledge of Java is needed.

## Limitations
This unit will only cover the printing of strings.
