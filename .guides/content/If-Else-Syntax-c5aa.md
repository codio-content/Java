## If Else Syntax

The if else statement checks to see if a condition is true, and then has specific actions that take place. But it also provides a specific set of actions if the boolean expression is false. Use the `else` keyword to introduce the code to run when false. Notice, `else` is aligned with the `if` keyword (no indentation) and has it's own set of curly braces `{}`. You do not write another boolean expression with `else`.

```java
if (5 > 4) {
    System.out.println("The boolean expression is true");
}
else {
    System.out.println("The boolean expression is false");
}
```

It is best practice to indent the lines of code within the curly braces to differentiate them but the indention does not effect how the program runs.

## What happens if you:
* Change `4` to `6`?
* Remove all the curly braces `{}`?
* Try to have 2 lines of code run when false without curly braces `{}`?
* Try to have 2 lines of code run when true without curly braces `{}`?
