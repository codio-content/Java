## While Loop Syntax
`while` loops, like `for` loops, use curly braces `{}` and indents for all commands that should be repeated. However, `for` loops generally contain 3 elements (an initialized variable, a boolean expression involving that variable, and a change in the value of that variable) while a `while` loop usually contains just a boolean expression. The `for` and `while` loops below produce the same results.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<div style="width:310px; height:150px">

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println("Loop#: "+i);
}
```

</div>
</td>
<td>
<div style="width:310px; height:150px">
          
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println("Loop# "+i);
  i++;
}
```

</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Note that the variable declaration and initialization happen *before* the start of the `while` loop and any changes that occur to the variable happen *within* the body of the curly braces `{}`. On the other hand, everything happens in one step within parentheses `()` when using a `for` loop.

Here is another example of a `while` loop that prints `Hello` based on the value of the variable `count`.

```java
int count = 5; // some random number set by user
while (count > 0) {
  System.out.println("Hello");
  count--;
}
```

## What happens if you:
* Change the while statement to `while (count > -1 * count)`?
* Replace `count--` in the code above with `count = count - 2`?
* Change the while statement to `while (count < 10)`?

<details><summary><b>How does <code>while (count > -1 * count)</code> work?</b></summary>To understand how the loop works, it's best to substitute values in for the variable <code>count</code>. In the first iteration, we have <code>while (5 > -1 * 5)</code>, this statement is true so the print command is executed. Since <code>count</code> gets decremented by 1 with each iteration, the <code>while</code> loop condition changes slightly every time like as follow: <ul style="margin-left: 20px"><li><code>while (4 > -1 * 4)</code></li><li><code>while (3 > -1 * 3)</code></li><li><code>while (2 > -1 * 2)</code></li><li><code>while (1 > -1 * 1)</code></li></ul>Once the condition gets to <code>while (0 > -1 * 0)</code>, it no longer holds true and the while loop ends. The result is 5 <code>Hello</code>s being printed to the screen.</details>

## Infinite Loops
Infinite loops are loops that do not have a test condition that causes them to stop. The following is a common mistake that results in an infinite loop:

```java
int count = 5; // some random number set by user
while (count > 0) {
  System.out.println("Hello");
}
```

Since the variable `count` never gets decremented. It remains at 5, and 5 will forever be greater than 0, so the loop will never stop.

Copy the code above and `TRY IT` to see what happens. Java will eventually stop the loop due to an output limit, but it may take some time before this happens.

## Why Use a While Loop?
If a `while` loop does the same thing as a `for` loop, then what is the purpose of having both? `while` loops are actually more useful when you are waiting for a certain event to occur. Imagine you are making a video game. The game should continue until the player loses all of their lives. You don't know how long this will take, so a `while` loop is more appropriate. On the other hand, if you have more specific loop parameters, a `for` loop will be better.

```java
int player_lives = 3;

while (player_lives > 0) {
  // video game code
  // goes here
}
```
