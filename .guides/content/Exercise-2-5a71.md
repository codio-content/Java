## Array to ArrayList
You want to convert the `oceans` array into an ArrayList. Here is what you have so far in the text editor to your left:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Exercise2 {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    
    ArrayList<String> oceans = new ArrayList<String>();
    
    //add code below this line



    //add code above this line
    
    System.out.println(oceans);
    
  }
}
```

Complete the program so that when printing `oceans`, you get the output:
```java
[Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, Southern]
```

{Try it}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/arrays/Exercise2.java java -cp code/arrays/ Exercise2 1)

### Requirements
* You **cannot** make any changes to the code that already exists. If you accidentally delete any existing code, you can copy and paste the entire program from above.
* You **must** include at least **ONE** `add()` method, at least **ONE** `remove()` method, and at least **ONE** `set()` method in your program.
