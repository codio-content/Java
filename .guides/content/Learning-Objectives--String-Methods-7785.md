## Assumptions
Students have already seen strings in the "Fundamentals" unit and the "String Basics" lesson. That is, they should be able to declare a string variable, use concatenation, and typecast variables of other types to strings.

## Limitations
Objects have not been formally introduced, so explaining methods may pose as a challenge.
