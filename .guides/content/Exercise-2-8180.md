## Strings Exercise 2

**Problem**
Write a program that captures text from the user. Print the user string as many times as its length. Print as many lines of this as the length of the user input. **Important**, do not put a prompt when asking for user input. Just use `input()`. Adding a prompt will cause your program to not pass the tests.

**Expected Output**
* If the user types `cat` then the program will print:
```python
catcatcat
catcatcat
catcatcat
```
* If the user types `tree` then the program will print:
```python
treetreetreetree
treetreetreetree
treetreetreetree
treetreetreetree
```
