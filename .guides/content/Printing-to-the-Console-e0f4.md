## Printing to the console
As you learn Java, you will write code in the text editor to the left. *There is already some code there we will cover later.* For now, use a `System.out.print` command to see the output of your program. Enter the code below and click the `TRY IT` button.

```java
System.out.print("Hello world");
```

{Try it}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/fundamentals/PlaygroundPrinting1.java java -cp code/fundamentals/ PlaygroundPrinting1 1 )

The reason you were able to see the words appear is because of the `System.out.print` command.

Change your code to look like this and run it again.

```java
"Hello world"
```
